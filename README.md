Authentication ASP MVC 5 with OWIN Security

### Description

This is a simple ASP MVC 5 basic project with a Custom Authentication using only the required assemblies
for Owin Security. Not database, not Entity Framework, not scheme based authentication. It's just a simple base
project with the Owin classes already configured ready to start to work and extend.

And don't worry, the project is tested =)
